# [Adventure!](http://game.alexvallorosi.com)

This is a text based adventure game written in Javascript for a computer programming 
class that I am taking at my high school. It uses HTML5 Boilerplate.

This project goes along with a presentation about why Javascript is a great language
for the web. The presentation uses Impress.JS and can be found below:
